# Scripts

This is a collection of a few of my miscellaneous scripts.

## The scripts

- **[backup-system](backup-system):** a script I use to backup my system to an encrypted external hard drive.
- **[notify-after](notify-after):** a python shell script (and decorator) that sends a desktop notification whenever a shell process or decorated function finishes execution.
- **[sms-decorator](sms-decorator):** a decorator that will send you a text message with details about the execution when a decorated function finishes execution.
